# My projects
!NEW **Fox**
Fox is a minimalist programming language that is executable only via the command-line. It has 3 functionnalities: basic math operations, text manipulation, file manipulation, and more than 15 commands. Link: https://github.com/TRWither/Fox

**Glitch**:
Glitch is a CLI text editor wrote in Python. It allows you to manage and edit your files.
For example, you can make and remove files, change the perimissions of a file...
The file edition is a bit hard because you can edit a file on a one-line input and you must rewrite
the entire content of the file.

**WLine**:
WLine is a CLI web browser wrote in Python. It extracts the HTML content of the web pages
you want to visit and print them. There are also some useful commands: a help command, a history
command...

**Debin**:
Debin is a very little CLI tool I made for fun. It is used to convert decimal numbers into binary.
That's all.

**What The Code**:
What The Code is an exotic programming language wrote in Python (with PLY). I made it just to break
your brain because this is a NONSENSE programming langugae. For example ? The end of a statement is
`.,` and you must use the operator `yay` to make a division.

# The languages I use
- Python
- C
- BASH
- HTML/CSS (YEAH I KNOW THESE LANGUAGES ARE NOT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES)

  -- *Python and C are the best programming languages*
