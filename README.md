# My projects
I made a command-line web browser: WLine.
A command-line text editor: Glitch.
A deciaml-to-binary converter: Debin.
A nonsense programming language: What The Code (WTC).
## The languages I use
1. Python
2. C (best language in my opinion)
3. HTML & CSS
4. BASH
## Coming soon...
I am actually working on a serious programming language...
